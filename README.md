## Input 
Input is the way the computer gets information from the user 

Note: Python initially treats input as a `string` type 

Ex. 

5 --> "5

Today is Monday --> "Today is Monday"

### Formula:
`variableName = input("PROMPT")`

PROMPT  - A question or statement that the computer asks the user 

 Python stores the __input__ in the __variableName__
 ## My Notes
 handler_input.request_envelope.request.intent.slots["myFood"].value is how you make a follow up question on Alexa
